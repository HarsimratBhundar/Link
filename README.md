A working P2P blockchain platform, which will be used by a network of university students for an experimental demonstration of PoA (Proof of Activity) consensus mechanism.

The system currently facilitates P2P interactions and block mining post requests. For now a proof-of-work algorithm is being used to achieve consensus, which will soon be replaced by a PoA.

(note: This project uses a large collection of node modules with over 100 files, and so the node modules are not uploaded along with the rest of the project)
